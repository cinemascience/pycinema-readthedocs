Cinema:View workspace

.. _view:

The **Cinema:View** workspace provides a *parallel coordinates view*, a *table*, *rendering controls* and an image view. The image view adjusts to show all images that are selected in the *parallel coordinates view*. Brushing and selecting on the the *parallel coordinates view* selects images that are then displayed in the image view. In this example, three objects are composited into a single image.
